"""
Hybrid executor: follows a static mid list while reacting to in-transit
assembly completions at runtime.

Cargo arm assembly rule (Mod 3):
  All products — including multi-layer products (Burger, Big Tree, Ice Cream) —
  are assembled by the AMR cargo arm on cargo slots 7/8.
  The workbench is used ONLY for RECYCLE (disassembly) in Phase 1 / the
  deferred recycle phase. No wb_task('PRODUCE') calls are ever issued.

Cargo overflow rule:
  If all cargo 2-6 slots are full and no in-transit slot is assembling yet,
  go to the workbench to drop materials as a buffer. Since the workbench no
  longer consumes anything, dropped materials are tracked in self._wb_buffer
  and reclaimed at the next checkpoint (see _reclaim_workbench_buffer) —
  they are never simply abandoned there.

Recycle disassembly rule (Phase 1):
  RECYCLE runs on the workbench asynchronously (wb_task_async), so the AMR
  drives off to fetch the next recycle product instead of idling at the
  workbench while it disassembles. Materials from the previous disassembly
  are always collected before the next product is placed on the workbench
  shelf. If cargo 2-6 fills up while multiple recycle products are in
  flight, the load is dropped at the workbench before heading to the next
  pickup instead of risking an overflow trip mid-route. Cargo 1 occupancy
  (one recycled product in transit at a time) is enforced by CargoManager
  itself (see PlannerNode.arm_pick_product/arm_unload_product_to_workbench),
  not just by this call ordering.

Deferred recycle rule (lifecycle produce-then-recycle):
  A recycle order whose product_id has no matching stock on the customer
  counter at plan time can't be disassembled up front — the robot must
  assemble and deliver it first. Plan.deferred_recycle_ids lists those
  product_ids; _run_deferred_recycle_phase() reclaims them from the customer
  counter and disassembles them after every delivery is otherwise complete.
  CargoAllocator prioritizes these produce orders (see planner_node.py's
  deferred_recycle_priority_boost) so they clear the pipeline early instead
  of waiting on num_blocks/weight ordering alone.

In-transit assembly rule (Mod 2):
  Completed products on cargo 7/8 are delivered directly from cargo 7/8
  to the customer counter — they do NOT move to cargo 1 first.
  When a slot is freed after delivery, CargoAllocator auto-assigns the next
  queued product to that slot; _start_ready_intransit_assembly() is called
  immediately in case the new product's materials are already loaded.
  _run_pickup_phase() checks for a completed slot after every single material
  pick (not just once per station) and delivers immediately when one is
  ready: a completed-but-undelivered slot can't take the next queued
  product, so every pick made while it sits idle is one more block stranded
  in cargo 2-6 with nothing to consume it. CargoAllocator.allocate() is also
  seeded with a completion-order priority (see planner_node.py's
  compute_completion_indices()) so the two active slots are always whichever
  produce orders have their full material set earliest along the route —
  minimizing how long unrelated queued orders' materials sit staged in
  cargo 2-6 before their turn. Together these are meant to keep the
  workbench overflow drop below from ever triggering in normal operation.

Two-phase navigation rule:
  Every station approach is split into two legs, always via _approach(id):
    1. navigate_subgoal(id)  — fast cruise; arm may ASSEMBLE during this leg.
       At sub_goal: wait_for_intransit_assembly() blocks until arm is idle.
    2. navigate_goal(id)     — precision parking; arm must be idle.
  Never call navigate_subgoal()/navigate_goal() directly — always go
  through _approach() so this rule can't be silently skipped at a new
  call site (see _approach() docstring for why that happened before).

Fail-loud / self-recovery rule:
  Every navigate/arm/wb call the Executor makes is checked against its
  return value; a failure raises ExecutionFailure instead of silently
  continuing with a plan that no longer matches physical reality. run()
  catches any such failure, makes one best-effort attempt to return the AMR
  to its home station anyway (so a mid-mission fault never strands it in
  the arena), and then re-raises so the caller sees a clear error instead of
  a silently-incomplete or hung run.
