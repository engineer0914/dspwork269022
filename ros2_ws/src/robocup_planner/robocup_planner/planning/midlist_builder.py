"""
Builds the midlist, bidlist, and the final mid (movement id list).

midlist — list-in-list of storage stations sorted by distance.
          Each element represents one station and its available materials.
          When recycling is needed, customer-counter entries are prepended
          as Phase 1, and storage distances are recalculated from the
          workbench position for Phase 2.

bidlist — same format as midlist, but for batch stations.
          IDs 10-80: materials field holds BATCH_COUNT units of the resolved
          raw material per batch ID. ID 90 (mix): is_mix_batch=True; materials
          field is populated via assign_mix_batch_materials() before inclusion.

mid     — midlist filtered to only the materials in net_aidlist,
          preserving distance order. This is the ordered pickup sequence
          the executor follows.
